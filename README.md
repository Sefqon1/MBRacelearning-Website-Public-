# MBRacelearning-Website-Public
This is the public version of the source code for the website [MBRacelearning](http://mbracelearning.com/).

**The project is several years old, but has been re-uploaded to a new repository without any sensitive data like static files and backend settings.**

The webiste is largely static, displaying content about the English teaching services offered and the teachers qualifications. 
It has a contact modal through which future clients are able to contact the teacher. The info of the contact modal is sent to the teachers GMAIL inbox via Googles SMTP. 

This functionality was built using the Django Web Framework for Python and Bootstrap to make the HTML and CSS dynamic and pretty. 

The website also has a blog section with full CRUD functionality and pagination. 
(*The blog is inactive and has yet to be filled with content*.)

##### Upcoming changes:

Due to Herokus free tier being discontinued as of November 2022, the site will have to be migrated to a different hosting service.
